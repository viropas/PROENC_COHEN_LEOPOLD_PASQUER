#First you need to know the size of your reads. If not, check the file "Reads length" before using GenomeScope

# Once you know the length of the reads, there are 2 different ways to use GenomeScope.

#1 Running GenomeScope Online. It is easy to use and offers a good web interface 

Link : http://genomescope.org/

#2 Running GenomeScope on the Command Line. You can run the commands with the R script. Make sure that the R script is in your PATH
