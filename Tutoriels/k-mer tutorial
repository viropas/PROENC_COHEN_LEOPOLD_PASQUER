#Once you have the histo file we will use R studio to visualize and to plot the data.  
# Using the following command, we will load the data from the kmer_out.histo file in to a data frame called dataframek.

```R
dataframek <- read.table("kmer_out.histo") #load the data into dataframek
plot(dataframek[1:200,], type="l") #plots the data points 1 through 200 in the dataframek using a line
```
# This will create a line graph using the first 200 data points
#In general, very low frequency k-mers represent high numbers that would skew the y â€“axis. If we look at the data points in the histogram file, we can see that the very first data point has a exceptionally high value than the next (second) data point. So we remove just the first line and re-plot using R. From now on we will disregard the first data point for our calculations.
```R
plot(dataframe19[2:200,], type="l")
```
